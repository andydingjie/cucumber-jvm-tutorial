cucumber-jvm-tutorial
=====================

This is a tutorial for beginners to learn about behavior driven development (BDD) using cucumber-jvm.

This tutorial comprises the following steps
* [Step 1](bdd-part-01-skeleton/README.md) We first walk through a skeleton Eclipse project. 
* [Step 2](bdd-part-02-features/README.md) We explore requirements using a mind-mapping technique using XMind. We then export requirements from XMind into *.feature files.
* [Step 3](bdd-part-03-test-skeleton) We generate skeleton test step definitions using cucumber-jvm.
* [Step 4](bdd-part-04-test-code) We implement the test definitions and evolve our code API until the test case passes.
* [Step 5](bdd-part-05-elaborate) We elaborate the requirements to support more sophisticated test cases. Here we learn more sophisticated use of the BDD Gherkin language.
* Step 6 You are now ready for your exercise!
